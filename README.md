# Document Indexing and Query-Document Matching Project

## Description
This project involves the development of a document indexing system and query-document matching. We utilize the "LISA" dataset to build an application that assesses various information retrieval models,
including vector space, boolean, and probabilistic models.

## Objectives
- Implementation of a document indexing system.
- Development of information retrieval models, including vector space, boolean, and probabilistic models.
- Evaluation of the models using the "LISA" dataset.
- Comparison of precision, recall, and F-measure metrics.

## Running the Application
To execute the interface, run UI/mainWindow
