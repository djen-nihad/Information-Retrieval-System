# Document Indexing and Query-Document Matching Project

## Description
This developed project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of retrieving relevant documents based on user queries by integrating multiple retrieval models and advanced indexing techniques. The system is evaluated using the LISA dataset, with performance measured through precision, recall, and F-measure to ensure optimal results.

## Objectives
- Implement and assess information retrieval models, including Vector Space, Boolean, and Probabilistic models.
- Evaluate the performance of these models using the LISA dataset.
- Compare the models using precision, recall, and F-measure metrics.

## Running the Application
To launch the user interface, run:  UI/mainWindow
